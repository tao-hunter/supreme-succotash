    "positive": "Combine and merge the reference image with transparent background and the original image to create a refined, high-quality result. Preserve the exact structure, proportions, and overall silhouette from the background-removed image. Ignore any background elements from the original image. Add any missing objects, details, or elements that may have been lost during background removal. Correct any color inaccuracies, fix incorrect shapes, and restore fine details. Faithfully reproduce realistic textures with proper depth, material characteristics, and surface qualities. Maintain decorative elements, carvings, moldings, and ornamental details with high refinement and realism. Ensure accurate color tones, material finishes, and realistic lighting to emphasize depth and realism. Use a flat, uniform, neutral solid-color background to clearly separate the object from the background. Ultra-high fidelity edit focused on combining both images seamlessly while preserving the clean background-removed structure and restoring lost details from the original.",
